#  DeepGunST: Deep Learning Handgun Multi-Level Alarm System based on spatial and temporal information fusion model to mitigate false alarms for handgun detection in video-surveillance 

The dataset used in this paper are:

1. HandgunTrajectory is the dataset for training models to predict the trajectory of handguns in videos. It contains five files: 
* HandGunTrayectory_1.txt
* HandGunTrayectory_2.txt
* HandGunTrayectory_3.txt
* HandGunTrayectory_4.txt
* HandGunTrayectory_5.txt

2. PistolDetection is the dataset used to train the handgun-detection model is available in:
